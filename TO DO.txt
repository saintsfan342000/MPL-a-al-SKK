- Adhere to Caswells advice of myfunction(ax,data,style,**kwargs) return artists
  - See https://youtu.be/1vAZ1bJZkXo?t=23m1s

COMPLETED TO DOs
- Create a walk-through example.  Find a typical SKK figure, and try to duplicate it.

- Adjust default arrow props? Slightly shorter, and thinner tail?
- Have myax return handles for the two axes that get created when adding a right ax?
- Some kind of eztext function definition to annotate the upper left, top right, etc. (eztext!)
- Add **kwargs to eztext to pass to p.text
- A label and arrow formatter for colorbars
  Done, but there is a bug.  Only works as a stand-alone function call in interactive mode
- Define a "make12" function like make quad but for 1x2 subplots
- Add feature to myax that lets you specify label position? i.e., add (ypos, xpos arguments?)  DONe==> nudge
- Change how myax() corrects the fontsize of fractions in y-axis labels ==> Done
- When creating a right y-axis, the ticklabel and axis label fontsizes are made to identical to the left y-axis.  This cannot be overridden.
- Done by specifying fontsize=ylab.get_fontsize() when setting ylabel on axR, and then axR.tick_params(labelsize=axR.yaxis.tick_labels()[0].get_fontsize())
---Reason:  I noticed that if a different style-sheet was called after instantiating a figure and axes, but before calling myax on that axes, then
            the label fontsize would be that of the newly-called style sheet.  Discovered in a looping plot script C_Multiplot of GMPT.
- An ezlegend function ==> Done
- Arrow sizes now are automatically scaled to the axes size to be the right shape and size!  autoscale argument.

FAILED TO DOs
- Add p.sca(axleft) to end of myax
    Didn't solve the problem of data referring to right axis after adding second axis
    ==> Solution:  use ax.plot!
