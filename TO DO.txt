- Add feature to myax that lets you specify label position?
i.e., add (ypos, xpos arguments?)
- Fig the right-aligned text positons in eztext
i.e., 0.99 is too close to right edge
- Change how myax() corrects the fontsize of fractions in y-axis labels
i.e., rather than specifying 35 or whatever, make it a 1.1*current fontsize so that the routing works for differnt layouts which use smaller fonts (i.e, mysty-quad)
- A label and arrow formatter for colorbars
  the same functions used for the y-axes in myax would work
  But some adjustment of the arrow size is needed since the cbar.ax is so narrow
  cbar.ax.yaxis gives the yaxis then all of the same methods of before work.

- Adhere to Caswells advice of myfunction(ax,data,style,**kwargs) return artists

COMPLETED TO DOs
- Create a walk-through example.  Find a typical SKK figure, and try to duplicate it.

- Adjust default arrow props? Slightly shorter, and thinner tail?
- Have myax return handles for the two axes that get created when adding a right ax?
- Some kind of extext function definition to annotate the upper left, top right, etc. (eztext!)

FAILED TO DOs
- Add p.sca(axleft) to end of myax
    Didn't solve the problem of data referring to right axis after adding second axis
