- Add feature to myax that lets you specify label position?
i.e., add (ypos, xpos arguments?)
- Change how myax() corrects the fontsize of fractions in y-axis labels
i.e., rather than specifying 35 or whatever, make it a 1.1*current fontsize so that the routing works for differnt layouts which use smaller fonts (i.e, mysty-quad)
- Define a "make12" function like make quad but for 1x2 subplots

- Adhere to Caswells advice of myfunction(ax,data,style,**kwargs) return artists
  - See https://youtu.be/1vAZ1bJZkXo?t=23m1s

  



COMPLETED TO DOs
- Create a walk-through example.  Find a typical SKK figure, and try to duplicate it.

- Adjust default arrow props? Slightly shorter, and thinner tail?
- Have myax return handles for the two axes that get created when adding a right ax?
- Some kind of extext function definition to annotate the upper left, top right, etc. (eztext!)
- Have myax return handles for the two axes that get created when adding a right ax?

- Add **kwargs to eztext to pass to p.text
- A label and arrow formatter for colorbars
  Done, but there is a bug.  Only works as a stand-alone function call in interactive mode



FAILED TO DOs
- Add p.sca(axleft) to end of myax
    Didn't solve the problem of data referring to right axis after adding second axis
