Getting Matplotlib to meet the maniacal figure standards of Dr. Stelios Kyriakides

## Now with a tutorial!  See "Tutorial.ipynb" for a little walkthrough.

My grad school advisor is a great man and a brilliant engineer.  We should all be so lucky as to find the passion for our work that he has for his. It's a privalege to work for him.

But the way he makes plots totally sucks.  I won't name the software, but let's just say that it makes me wish I could use excel.  He uses it because he likes to tinker with plots: add arrows on the axis labels, put annotations all over the place, etc.  It's excessive, IMO:  the annotations detract from the often-significant message of the plot.  But that's his taste, so it is what it is and I don't fight it.  But Kaleidagraph...oh man.  I'll fight it til the day I die (or graduate, whichever comes first).

Motivated by my disdain for this POS software for which the most recent version was release in the last 5 years but still looks and operates like the original version from 1990; motivated by the hope that if I could make identical-looking figures through some other platform then I could stop using that pathetic program; and hoping to just learn a whole lot more about matplotlib...
Here are some style sheets and functions which get us really stinkin' close to his standards.
